    "# Application Programming Interfaces\n",
    "Application Programming Interfaces (API) or API endpoint are a way for computer programs and tools to communicate with each other. Typical interactions include web API's communication from website to website or website to a computer. The API will reside in the source website and the developer and owner of the API will have some instructions and documentation on how to submit requests, download data, query parameters available, among other features. Most API's require registration to the owners Website/API as well as accepting user terms of service. An API may include some data but not all data available in a website. An API endpoint  \n",

    "One example of an open API is [Open Notify](http://api.open-notify.org) which is an open source project that provides a simple API for some of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) data. This Jupyter Notebook uses this API to run some example on how API downloaded data could be converted to Pandas usable data.\n",

    "Status codes are returned with every request that is made to a web server. Status codes indicate information about what happened with a request. Here are some codes that are relevant to GET requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).\n",
    "- 301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.\n",
    "- 400: The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.\n",
    "- 401: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials, so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API.\n",
    "- 403: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right perlessons to see it.\n",
    "- 404: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server.\n",

OPM is issuing final regulations to provide agencies with greater flexibility to staff foreseeably long-term projects of a STEM-related nature when the need for the work is not permanent. The intended effect of this change is to allow agencies the flexibility and discretion to hire individuals with knowledge, skills, and abilities tailored to a specific project that may not be required on a permanent basis or transferable to other functions of the agency. This longer-term appointment may also assist agencies in recruiting individuals with certain specialized knowledge, who may be interested in acquiring further skills and experience working on a project basis and would be less likely to pursue or accept a career position. This authority is not intended to be a substitute for regular agency hiring but is instead intended to be a supplement to existing hiring authorities that is targeted for longer-term projects that are not permanent in nature.

The annual indexation of these amounts is required notwithstanding the Board's action in March 2020 of setting all reserve requirement ratios to zero. The Regulation D amendments set the reserve requirement exemption amount for 2023 at $36.1 million (increased from $32.4 million in 2022) and the amount of the low reserve tranche at $691.7 million (increased from $640.6 million in 2022). The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act (the ``Act''). The annual indexation of the reserve requirement exemption amount and low reserve tranche, though required by statute, will not affect depository institutions' reserve requirements, which will remain zero.\",\n",

Federal Reserve Bank (Reserve Bank) stockholders that have total consolidated assets above the threshold receive a different dividend rate on their Reserve Bank stock than stockholders with total consolidated assets at or below the threshold. The Federal Reserve Act requires that the Board annually adjust the total consolidated asset threshold to reflect the change in the Gross Domestic Product Price Index, published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Based on the change in the Gross Domestic Product Price Index as of September 29, 2022, the total consolidated asset threshold will be $12,124,000,000 through December 31, 2023.',\n",

(CFM) CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B model turbofan engines with a certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) inner stationary seal installed. AD 2021-10-09 requires removal, inspection, and replacement of the affected HPT inner stationary seal and, depending on the findings, replacement of the rotating air HPT front seal, HPT rotor blades, and No. 3 ball bearing. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-10-09, the manufacturer notified the FAA that the service information incorrectly lists the year of certain honeycomb repairs. Additionally, the manufacturer notified the FAA that affected HPT inner stationary seals could potentially be installed on CFM CFM56-5C model turbofan engines. This proposed AD would require removal, inspection, and replacement of the affected HPT inner stationary seal and, depending on the findings, replacement of the rotating air HPT front seal, HPT rotor blades, and No. 3 ball bearing. This proposed AD would also revise the applicability to add CFM CFM56- 5C model turbofan engines. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.',\n",

This proposed AD was prompted by a report of multiple aborted takeoffs and air turn-backs (ATBs) caused by high-pressure compressor (HPC) stall, which was induced by high levels of non-synchronous vibration (NSV). A subsequent investigation by the manufacturer revealed that wear on the No. 3 bearing spring finger housing can lead to high levels of NSV. This proposed AD would require repetitive calculations of the oil filter delta pressure (OFDP) data and, depending on the results of the calculation, replacement of the No. 3 bearing spring finger housing. This proposed AD would also prohibit installation of an engine with an affected No. 3 bearing spring finger housing onto an airplane that already has one engine with an affected No. 3 bearing spring finger housing installed. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.',\n",

In this action, we are proposing updates to the current New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for secondary lead smelters and proposing a new NSPS subpart that applies to affected sources constructed, reconstructed, or modified after the date of this proposed rule. For the current NSPS subpart, we are proposing to revise the definitions of blast furnace, reverberatory furnace, and pot furnace to more closely align with the equipment definitions used in the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for secondary lead smelting. We are also proposing requirements for periodic performance tests for particulate matter (PM) and incorporating revised monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, including electronic reporting of performance tests, to be more consistent with the NESHAP. For the new subpart, we are proposing updated PM and opacity emissions limits for blast, reverberatory, and pot furnaces that reflect the performance achieved by the best system for emissions reductions (BSER). In the new subpart, we are proposing PM and opacity emissions limits that apply at all times, including during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM), and proposing initial and periodic PM and opacity performance testing and the same equipment definitions, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements proposed for current NSPS subpart.\",\n",
